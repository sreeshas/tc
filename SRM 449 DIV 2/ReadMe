This is one of the beautiful math problem ive seen so far.

I did not realize until i saw "justforlaugh"'s solution.

Instead of actually calculating the traversed path, his solution simply takes the minimum and maximum values of
start and finish array respectively and calculates the size.

I was trying to understand how this worked but got the intuition only after observing the figure. if you can imagine
a square in between mountains (in the illustrated figure), it would actually be one big isoscelos triangle, which would
give the right answer.

Mind blown!
